# phase-3-SQL-articles

A Python application modeling Authors, Articles, and Magazines with a SQLite database using raw SQL queries. This project implements object-oriented programming principles, raw SQL operations, and proper database relationships without using SQLAlchemy.

## Project Overview

This project models a many-to-many relationship between `Authors`, `Articles`, and `Magazines`:
- An `Author` can write many `Articles`.
- A `Magazine` can publish many `Articles`.
- An `Article` belongs to both an `Author` and a `Magazine`.
- The `Author`-`Magazine` relationship is many-to-many through the `Articles` table.

The application uses SQLite for data persistence, includes a comprehensive test suite, and provides a CLI tool for interactive querying.

## Features
* Author, Article, and Magazine classes with SQL-based CRUD operations
* Relationship methods for articles, magazines, and authors
* Transaction handling and error management
* Comprehensive test suite
* CLI tool for interactive querying
* Optimized SQL queries with indexes

## Database Schema
* authors: id, name
* magazines: id, name, category
* articles: id, title, author_id, magazine_id    

## Setup Instructions
